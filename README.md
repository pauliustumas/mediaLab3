# Requirements for repository
  - You have to clone this repository and make two branches (master and develop).
  - The develop branch should contain commits of every new feature of the AR application.
  - When all features will be ready you have to merge the development branch to the master.

# Requirements for AR application
There are three options to choose from.

Option A:
  - Create a 3D model using Three.js and integrate into laboratory sample.
  - 3D model must be complex structure made by you.

Option B:
  - Make your own marker like 'Hiro'.
  - The application should be able to recognize your marker and display a cube when it is present.

Option C:
  - It is your chance to show your skills and creativity.
